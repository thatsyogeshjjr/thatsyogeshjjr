## Overview

I work on robotics systems with an emphasis on control, simulation, and human–machine interfaces.  
My focus is on understanding how systems behave under real-world constraints by moving between theory, modeling, and physical prototyping.

This GitHub is a living archive of experiments, replications, and exploratory builds developed alongside an independent, structured curriculum in robotics systems research.

## What I Work On

- Robotics systems modeling and control  
- Simulation-first analysis (MATLAB / Simulink, Python)  
- Embedded systems and electronics (analog + digital)  
- Human–machine interfaces and wearable robotics  
- System-level prototyping driven by failure and iteration  

---

## Selected Projects & Experiments

- **Control System Replication & Analysis**
  Recreating classical and modern control systems in simulation to study stability, sensitivity, and failure modes beyond ideal assumptions.

- **Simulation-First Robotics Experiments**
  Small-scale robotics experiments explored through modeling and simulation before hardware implementation, focusing on system behavior and constraints.
  
- **Technical Notes & Research Logs**
  Structured notes and experiments documenting insights from robotics literature, simulations, and failed implementations, maintained as reproducible references.

## Tools & Methods

- MATLAB / Simulink  
- Python, C  
- KiCad, Fusion 360  
- Oscilloscopes, logic analyzers  
- Embedded prototyping and test instrumentation

## How I Think

I treat engineering as a process of making systems legible.  
If it works, good.  
If it breaks, even better — now I know where not to trust the model.

I enjoy hacking up AI and robotics with limited resources, questionable hardware, and a willingness to learn by breaking things

*Learning fast. Building rigor. Breaking just enough to understand.*
