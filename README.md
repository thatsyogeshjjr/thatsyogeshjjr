## Overview

I work on robotics systems with an emphasis on control, simulation, and human–machine interfaces.  
My focus is on understanding how systems behave under real-world constraints by moving between theory, modeling, and physical prototyping.

This GitHub is a living archive of experiments, replications, and exploratory builds developed alongside an independent, structured curriculum in robotics systems research.

## What I Work On

- Robotics systems modeling and control  
- Simulation-first analysis (MATLAB / Simulink, Python)  
- Embedded systems and electronics (analog + digital)  
- Human–machine interfaces and wearable robotics  
- System-level prototyping driven by failure and iteration  

---

## Selected Projects & Experiments

- **Lower Limb & Arm Exoskeleton Prototypes**  
  Exploratory mechanical and electronic builds to study actuation, sensing, and control limits.

- **Modular Electronics for Research-Grade Robotics**  
  Designing modular electronic subsystems with minimal abstraction to preserve system intuition.

- **RC Plane — Full Stack Aero–Mech–Electro Build**  
  End-to-end design focusing on dynamics, control surfaces, and power systems.

- **Simulation & Replication Studies**  
  Recreating and stress-testing robotics and control concepts from literature to expose assumptions and failure modes.

## Tools & Methods

- MATLAB / Simulink  
- Python, C  
- KiCad, Fusion 360  
- Oscilloscopes, logic analyzers  
- Embedded prototyping and test instrumentation

## How I Think

I treat engineering as a process of making systems legible.  
If it works, good.  
If it breaks, even better — now I know where not to trust the model.

I enjoy hacking up AI and robotics with limited resources, questionable hardware, and a willingness to learn by breaking things

*Learning fast. Building rigor. Breaking just enough to understand.*
