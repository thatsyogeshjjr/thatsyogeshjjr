## Overview

I work on robotics systems with an emphasis on control, simulation, and human–machine interfaces.  
My focus is on understanding how systems behave under real-world constraints by moving between theory, modeling, and physical prototyping.

This GitHub is a living archive of experiments, replications, and exploratory builds developed alongside an independent, structured curriculum in robotics systems research.
