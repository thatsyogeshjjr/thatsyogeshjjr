## 🧠 About Me

🎓 Robotics & AI student | 🔬 Research-driven builder | 🥋 Karate kid by dawn, hacker by dusk  
I break things to learn, build fast to understand, and never wait for a syllabus to start shipping.

💥 I specialize in:
- Embedded Systems | Control Systems | Analog + Digital Electronics
- OS & Compiler Design (yes, I wrote one… on purpose)
- MATLAB | Simulink | C | Python | JS | Fusion 360 | Ansys
- Turning cardboard into exoskeletons and calculators into power supplies

🚀 Current Motto:  
**“If it works, great. If it breaks, even better — now I know what not to do.”**

## 🔧 Current Projects

- 🦾 Lower Limb & Arm Exoskeleton Prototypes (Cardboard → Real)
- ⚙️ Modular Electronics for Research-Grade Robotics (No MCU? No Problem.)
- ✈️ RC Plane from Scratch – Full-stack aero-mech-electro build
- 🧠 Self-Study CS + Biz Degree Sprint (Because why not both?)
- 🤖 Hacking up AI and Robotics with my CCE potato [@maahiWritesLogic](https://github.com/mahiWritesLogic)

## 🧰 Tools I Love

- 🛠️ KiCAD, MATLAB, VS Code, Terminal, Logic Analyzers, Oscilloscopes
- 📊 I turn calculators into number-crunching beasts (yes, even CW-991FX)
- 🎯 Design style? Tony Stark meets Tokyo garage

## 🌱 Always Learning

- High-speed learning sprints in everything from AI pipelines to Web3
- How to teach without teaching: summer school initiative in progress
- Building real-world systems before the world expects me to

## 💡 Fun Facts

- I believe discipline ≠ dullness (try karate at 4am and soldering at 4pm)
- My violin is slowly forgiving me for the 6-month break
- I think faster with a problem than with a prompt

### 👾 Let’s Connect

Feel free to dive into my repos, borrow an idea, remix a schematic, or just say hey.  
If you want to build weird and wild stuff that actually *works* — we’ll get along just fine.
